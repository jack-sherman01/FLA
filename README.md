# FLA: Force-Language-Action Model for Robot Safe Contact-Rich Manipulation
this project is in progress.
## Overview
Motivation: Fine-tuning by safe RL with force and torque perception to advance the safe performance of VLA for manipulation, especially contact-rich tasks.

## TODO
- [ ] Deploy common VLA models locally
    - [x] OpenVLA
    - [ ] RDT
    - [ ] Others...
- [ ] Evaluate performance of each VLA model as baselines
    - [x] OpenVLA
- [ ] Add F/T sensor integration for each setup
- [ ] Create 5-10 contact-rich task environments

## Results
### Baselines
- OpenVLA:
    - *Results pending*
- RDT:
    - *Results pending*

### Our Approach
*Work in progress*

## Open Questions
- How to create a scale of contact-rich tasks environments?
- *Add more questions as they arise*
